# Counter-App
A Simple Counter App in Android that increases the count number on click of the button.

Inspired by the Udemy course on [**The Complete Android 15 Course -Build 82 Apps [Java& Kotlin]**](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-android-10-developer-course-mastering-android/) Created by [Abbass Masri](https://www.udemy.com/user/mahmoud-masri-7/).

# Understood and Implemented concepts-
